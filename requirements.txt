For the word embeddings a folder called 'models' is necessary. Put a GloVe embedding model in that directory. This will create a w2v file which the system can open and use. 
Model used in this project: Common Crawl (42B tokens, 1.9M vocab, uncased, 300d vectors, 1.75 GB download) download here: https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/
