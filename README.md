### Annotations
This folder contains annotations of 10 articles by 4 annotators. The corpus consists of 5 articles by the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention USA) and 5 articles from different webpages. All annotations were made with the eHost software, and all of the annotators except for annotator 4 (Felix) used the windows distribution of the software. Annotator 4 annotated with the Mac OS X distribution. This is relevant since these versions are not cross compatible.
